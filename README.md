# i3barscript

A node.js script that outputs i3 bar protocol json. Meant to be used as the "status-command" in i3's config file. This script is intended for personal use so it makes a few assumptions: 

* [Font-Awesome Font](http://fontawesome.io/) is installed
* [Google Play Music Desktop App](https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/) is installed
